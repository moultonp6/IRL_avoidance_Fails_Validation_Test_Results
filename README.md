"# IRL_avoidance_Fails_Validation_Test_Results" 

This repository is created to show that the proposed "weigthed IRL method" by Billard et al in Nature Communications Biology(link below) fails the validation tests as mentioned in the criticisms on pubpeer platform.

This repository has been provided to the readers to test that their algorithm indeed fails to learn the reward given a set of trajectories and associated weights. One can run this repository to check it themselves.

Coming soon...
  -- We will provide instructions on how to use this repository if needed to check that the author's algorithm fails
  -- There has been minimal changes in the code, as the author's original repository does not even run on many machines. But there has been no change to their core algorithm
