# IRL_avoidance_Fails_Validation_Test_Results

This repository is created to show that the proposed "weigthed IRL method" by Billard et al in Nature Communications Biology(link below) fails the validation tests as mentioned in the criticisms on pubpeer platform.

There has been minimal changes made to make the author's algorithms run (otherwise it throws errors on matlab) but the core algorirthm remains intact. 

This repository has been provided to the readers to test that their algorithm indeed fails to learn the reward given a set of trajectories and associated weights. One can run this repository to check it themselves. The results published in the criticism on pubpeer were produced by running these codes.

# Coming soon...


  -- We will soon provide more instructions on how to use this repository if needed to check that the author's algorithm fails
